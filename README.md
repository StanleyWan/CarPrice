# CarPrice
Assignment 11.1 What Drives the Price of a Car

# Overview
This project explores a used car dataset: [vehicles.csv](data/vehicles.csv) of 426,000 used cars (sampled from the original Kaggle dataset of 3 million entries) with the goal of identifying the key factors that influence used car prices. The analysis follows the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to ensure a structured and repeatable approach.

The final deliverable provides actionable insights and recommendations to a client—a used car dealership—on what consumers value most when purchasing a used car.
