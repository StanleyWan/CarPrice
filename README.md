# CarPrice
Assignment 11.1 What Drives the Price of a Car

##Overview
This project explores a dataset of 426,000 used cars (sampled from the original Kaggle dataset of 3 million entries) with the goal of identifying the key factors that influence used car prices. The analysis follows the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to ensure a structured and repeatable approach.

This [dataset](https://github.com/StanleyWan/Coupon/blob/main/prompt.ipynb) is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

The final deliverable provides actionable insights and recommendations to a client—a used car dealership—on what consumers value most when purchasing a used car.
